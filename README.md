Description: Chess program written in python 3.
Required Modules/Libraries: Pygame, copy

After creating a Hasami Shogi Board game for a class portfolio project, I decided that I wanted to create a chess program, as it is a game I am more acquainted with and fond of. I am still currently in the process of writing this program, as there are some necessary but missing functionality yet to be added (i.e. en passant rule for pawns or recording player moves).


--------------------------
Features to be added:

-Multiple Games:
Currently the program is set up where the user can only play one game upon starting the script. Once I have worked out all the actual game mechanics, I intend to add some extra pygame windows which let the user reset the board after completeing a game. 

-Move Recording:
Currently there is no method or function that records the player's piece moves. I'm hoping this is a relatively simple feature to add, but I would also like the program to be able to play a saved game by traversing through a previous game's recorded move list. 

-AI computer opponent:
I am still fairly new to python and programming in general, so it may be awhile before I learn enough to develope an AI player for this program but this is definitely a feature I would eventually like to add on to the program.
